### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


<!--
**AdamLanglois/AdamLanglois** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at TopGolf in Virginia Beach
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently C++, Python, and JavaScript
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate any open source projects that need help
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting started as a novice programmer that has yet to graduate college
- âš¡ Fun fact: Cucumbers are melons and strawberries aren't berries
