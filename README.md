### Hi there I'm Adam ðŸ‘‹

<br />

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at TopGolf in Virginia Beach
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++, Python, and JavaScript
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate any open source projects that need help
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting started as a novice programmer with an intrest in augmented reality that has yet to get a degree
- âš¡ Fun fact: Cucumbers are melons and strawberries aren't berries

<br />

I was never really introduced to information technology or computer science until college where got way to invested and a few sleepless nights later here I am.
